/// This chapter covers:
/// - Fundamentals of networking applications.
/// - Utilizing threads and ensuring data safety.
/// - Implementing our own basic communication protocol.
/// - Building a simple chat client and server.

// Building a project that has networking capabilities also requires more library fils in order to link properly,
// specifically 'sfml-network.lib', 'ws2_32.lib', and 'winmm.lib'.
// Having these libraries included will ensure that the project compiles properly.
